# BeeGFS metadata service configuration.

# Note: This file is only used together with sysV init scripts.
#       If your system uses systemd, this file is ignored.
#       In this case:
#          
#        - use `systemctl enable / disable`   to activate / decativate a service
#          
#        - systemd service templates are used for multimode
#          (See https://www.beegfs.io/wiki/MultiMode)
#
#
# Set to "NO" to disable start of the BeeGFS metadata daemon via the init
# script.
START_SERVICE="YES"

# Set to "YES" if you want to start multiple metadata daemons with different
# configuration files on this machine.
#
# Create a subdirectory with the ending ".d" in "/etc/beegfs/" for every config
# file. The subdirectory name will be used to identify a particular server
# instance for init script start/stop.
#
# Note: The original config file in /etc/beegfs will not be used when multi-mode
# is enabled.
#
# Example: /etc/beegfs/scratch.d/beegfs-meta.conf
# $ /etc/init.d/beegfs-meta start scratch
MULTI_MODE="NO"
