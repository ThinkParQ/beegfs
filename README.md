# BeeGFS Parallel File System
BeeGFS (formerly FhGFS) is the leading parallel cluster file system,
developed with a strong focus on performance and designed for very easy
installation and management.
If I/O intensive workloads are your problem, BeeGFS is the solution.

# Build Instructions

## Prerequisites
Before building BeeGFS, install the following dependency packages:

### Red Hat / CentOS
```
$ yum install libuuid-devel libibverbs-devel librdmacm-devel libattr-devel redhat-rpm-config \
  rpm-build xfsprogs-devel zlib-devel ant gcc-c++ gcc \
  redhat-lsb-core java-devel unzip libcurl-devel elfutils-libelf-devel kernel-devel 
  libblkid-devel libnl3-devel
```

The `elfutils-libelf-devel` and `kernel-devel` packages can be omitted if you don't intend to
build the client module.

The additional `devtoolset-7` package is also required,
which provides a newer compiler version. The installation steps are outlined here.
Please consult the documentation of your distribution for details.

  1. Install a package with repository for your system:
   - On CentOS, install package centos-release-scl available in CentOS repository:
     ```
     $ sudo yum install centos-release-scl
     ```
   - On RHEL, enable RHSCL repository for you system:
     ```
     $ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
     ```
  2. Install the collection:
     ```
     $ sudo yum install devtoolset-7
     ```

  3. Start using software collections:
     ```
     $ scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
     ```
  4. Follow the instructions below to build BeeGFS.

### Debian
On Debian or Ubuntu based systems run this command to install the required packages:
```
$ sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake pkg-config devscripts debhelper \
  libtool libattr1-dev xfslibs-dev lsb-release kmod librdmacm-dev libibverbs-dev \
  default-jdk ant dh-systemd zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libblkid-dev uuid-dev \
  libnl-3-200 libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-200 libnl-route-3-200 libnl-route-3-dev
```
Note: If you have an older Debian system you might have to install the
`module-init-tools` package instead of `kmod`.
You also have the choice between
the openssl, nss, or gnutls version of `libcurl-dev`. Choose the one you prefer.

## Building Packages

### For development systems

BeeGFS comes with a Makefile capable of building packages for the system on which it is executed.
These include all services, the client module and utilities.

To build RPM packages, run
```
 $ make package-rpm PACKAGE_DIR=packages
```
You may also enable parallel execution with
```
 $ make package-rpm PACKAGE_DIR=packages RPMBUILD_OPTS="-D 'MAKE_CONCURRENCY <n>'"
```
where `<n>` is the number of concurrent processes.

For DEB packages use this command:
```
 $ make package-deb PACKAGE_DIR=packages
```
Or start with `<n>` jobs running in parallel:
```
 $ make package-deb PACKAGE_DIR=packages DEBUILD_OPTS="-j<n>"
```

This will generate individual packages for each service (management, meta-data, storage)
as well as the client kernel module and administration tools.

The above examples use `packages` as the output folder for packages, which must not exist
and will be created during the build process.
You may specify any other non-existent directory instead.

Note, however, that having `PACKAGE_DIR` on a NFS or similar network share may slow down
the build process significantly.

### For production systems, or from source snapshots

By default the packaging system generates version numbers suitable only for development
packages. Packages intended for installation on production systems must be built differently.
All instructions to build development packages (as given above) apply, but additionally the
package version must be explicitly set. This is done by passing `BEEGFS_VERSION=<version>`
in the make command line, e.g.
```
 $ make package-deb PACKAGE_DIR=packages DEBUILD_OPTS="-j<n>" BEEGFS_VERSION=7.1.4-local1
```

Setting the version explicitly is required to generate packages that can be easily upgraded
with the system package manager.


## Building without packaging
To build the complete project without generating any packages,
simply run
```
$ make
```

The sub-projects have individual make targets, for example `storage-all`,
`meta-all`, etc.

To speed things you can use the `-j` option of `make`.
Additionally, the build system supports `distcc`:
```
$ make DISTCC=distcc
```
