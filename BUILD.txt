Quickstart Guide to BeeGFS Package Building
===========================================

Build dependencies
------------------

Before building BeeGFS, install the following dependency packages:

* Depedencies for RPM packages (Red Hat):
  libuuid-devel libibverbs-devel librdmacm-devel libattr-devel redhat-rpm-config
  rpm-build xfsprogs-devel cppunit cppunit-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel sqlite
  sqlite-devel ant gcc-c++ gcc redhat-lsb-core java-devel kernel-devel elfutils-libelf-devel

The `elfutils-libelf-devel` and `kernel-devel` packages can be omitted if you don't intend to
build the client module.

* Dependencies for DEB packages (Debian):
  gcc g++ autoconf automake devscripts debhelper libtool libattr1-dev 
  xfslibs-dev lsb-release module-init-tools librdmacm-dev libibverbs-dev 
  default-jdk ant dh-systemd libcppunit-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev sqlite3
  libsqlite3-dev


Building all packages together
------------------------------

BeeGFS comes with a shell script that can build all BeeGFS packages for the
system on which it is executed.

Go to the "beegfs_auto_package" subdir:
 $ cd beegfs_auto_package

For RPM packages and example, see:
 $ ./make-rpms.sh -h

For DEB packages and example, see:
 $ ./make-debs.sh -h


Building individual packages
----------------------------

Every BeeGFS service directory ("beegfs_meta", "beegfs_storage", ...) has a
subdir named "build", which contains a makefile. Some makefiles contain a "help"
target, so "make help" can be used in these cases to see build options.

Before building a BeeGFS service, some shared libraries need to be prepared:
 $ make -j4 -C beegfs_thirdparty/build
 $ make -j4 -C beegfs_opentk_lib/build
 $ make -j4 -C beegfs_common/build

Now you can build the actual services, e.g. beegfs_meta:
$ make -j4 -C beegfs_meta/build

Or you can build a RPM/DEB package for a particular service, e.g. for
beegfs_meta:
 $ cd beegfs_meta/build
 $ ./make-rpm # for a RPM package
 $ ./make-deb # for a DEB package
