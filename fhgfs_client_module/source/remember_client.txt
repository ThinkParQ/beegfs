//// always keep in mind ////
- never wait sleeping (e.g. on a mutex, malloc or communication) when holding a spinlock
	- because if other processes wake up and try to acquire a spinlock, they will not be
		preemptible and hence we will never wake up to unlock the mutex
	- that means we also cannot use the normal fhgfs logger while holding a spinlock
- work will be freed by the workers, so each work has to be alloced seperately
- StringTk::strToInt64 returns unsigned (because simple_strtoll was undefined in some kernel
	versions)
- NicList is unsorted (relies on appropriate server-side NicList order)
- userspace pointers can only be used within the user-process context, not by other kernel threads
- vector-impls store value pointers (not the elemStruct pointers). hence, if there should be
	a method like "setNewValue()" for lists, the vector wouldn't notice
	- of course, we could change to elem-pointers if we need to fix that
- ibverbs (OFED documentation quotes):
	- "Because low-level drivers are reentrant, upper level protocol consumers are not required
		to perform any serialization."
	- "Upper level protocol consumers may not sleep in a callback."
- mutexes and reference counts:
	- successful kernel mutex lock doesn't guarantee that unlock is fully completed and the 
		mutex is no longer accessed by another thread, so mutex deletion based on successful
		mutex acquire is not possible.
